I strongly disapprove of the way they handled that situation; it was completely irresponsible.
It's disappointing to see such a lack of integrity in their actions.
I can't condone their behavior; it goes against all ethical principles.
Their decision was ill-advised and poorly thought out.
I'm not at all pleased with the way they've been managing this project.
It's disheartening to witness such a blatant disregard for the rules.
Their constant procrastination is unacceptable; it's time to take action.
I find it hard to support a decision that appears to be so shortsighted.
The way they treated their colleagues was disrespectful and inexcusable.
So then don't load. Otherwise it's not available then load.
